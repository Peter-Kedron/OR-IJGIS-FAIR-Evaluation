## Abstract

Academic journals increasingly require data and code sharing to improve computational reproducibility, but the effectiveness of these policies remains unclear. This study evaluates the impact of the Open Data + FAIR policy implemented by the International Journal of Geographic Information Science (IJGIS) in August 2019 through a systematic audit of 351 articles published between 2020-2024, compared against 32 articles from the pre-policy period. Using a five-star reproducibility framework based on FAIR principles, we assessed data and code availability, metadata quality, and adherence to open science standards. Results show significant improvement in material availability post-policy, with most articles now including data and code compared to minimal sharing pre-policy. However, computational reproducibility remained limited, with most articles achieving only 1-2 star ratings due to inadequate metadata, unclear workflow documentation, and missing computational environment details. While the policy successfully increased compliance with basic sharing requirements, it failed to facilitate the comprehensive documentation necessary for independent reproduction. These findings suggest that journal policies focused solely on availability are insufficient for achieving computational reproducibility in geographic research, highlighting the need for enhanced standards addressing metadata, workflow documentation, and computational environments.

## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

- `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
- `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
- `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
- `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.
